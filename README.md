# TopographicalHexagons
Here I will take the SRTM datasets and generate topographical maps from them that can be reshaped into hexagons. From there, I will aim to create a 3D-printable file containing the topographical data.

Data has been taken from the website https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ with the original publication coming from NASA. https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/
